# React-Client-Side-Validation
When I am learning new frameworks such as React, I found that you can learn a lot through the process of customizing some good boilerplate code. Here is some client-side validation code published by Sourav Mondal that I found very helpful. I've added an onBlur and onFocus event to improve the way error messages are delivered, and I added hook that allows you to run a database check to see if a value, such as a username, is already taken. The original code can be found here:
